RSS feed description and article snipping

## Introduction
I'm trying to use RSS feeds to curate my own internet experience.  It's been pretty succcessful so far, but I haven't found a good way to synchronize
the feeds between computers so far. The most basic RSS readers I use are local-only.

However, you can import and export the subscriptions.  For now, I'm just going to version control the export file here, and pull it as necessary.
I expect that there will be a flurry of activity as I discover new feeds, but then it will die down in a couple weeks, and I'll be mostly pulling 
as I move between computers.

## TODO
Add a handy way to save articles.  I'm thinking of a webservice that I can send URLs to which
- Makes a PDF of the page
- Captures the URL
- Maybe grabs a Web Archive snapshot?
- Then makes a pull-request or commit to this repo
